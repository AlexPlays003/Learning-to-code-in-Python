# Instructions

Welcome to learning to code in python!

I made this repository to interest new people into coding.

To start, you will need python V 3.0+ (I have not tested in older versions) and pygame installed
(if you need to install pygame, use this guide https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

I tried to make it as flexible and understandable as possible.

If you have any feedback, let me know.

To run the game, simply run the __init__ file

You can use these commands while on the pygame window:

 p - play the game
 l - load game into string
 n - next level
 b - previous level

Thanks a lot, I hope you have fun!
