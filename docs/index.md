# Hello!

I hope you can find this guide helpful.

Here, I will describe how to get things all started up and working.

## If you know that you are doing:

Go to [my repository](https://github.com/MrDrHax/Learning-to-code-in-Python/releases/) and download the latest release.

for more detailed instructions, continue reading:

## Introductions...

Before you can start using this software, you will need to download python, and pygame. Follow these steps to download python:

## Downloading python

To download python go to [the python webpage](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the installer. 

Once it is downloaded, open it. 

Follow all the steps, and if you are on Windows, make sure to check the "add to path" checkbox.


once you have it downloaded, try opening a command line terminal (search cmd)

finally, type:

>python

and press enter
if everything is configured correctly, a python terminal will appear.

to exit python, type:

>exit()

and press enter

do not close the terminal yet, we will be using it later.

## Downloading pygame

On the same terminal you had oppen, use the next command:

>pip install pygame

and press enter.

pip (python's package manager) will install pygame for you, you just go out and get a snack while it is getting downloaded.

if windows sends an error, try using one of the next:

>pip3 install pygame

>python pip install pygame

>python3 pip install pygame

if none of this works, then you are on your own (google it, it should be a quick fix), and make sure that python was installed to path... very important

## Finally, runing the game

Go to [my repository](https://github.com/MrDrHax/Learning-to-code-in-Python/releases/) and download the latest release.

Unzip the folder

Enter the folder and find the __init__.py file

Open the file, or right-click, and open with python

There, all the code should be working, have fun!
