Welcome to learning to code in Python!

here, you will (hopefully) learn how to code like a pro when you finish
or at least at a more than basic level.

To start of, try typing 

     move()

after this comment (limited by the 3 ')

if you mess up, don't worry, use the r key to reset while focused on the game window (not the notepad)

to play your code just press p, again, focused on the game window

Good luck!
