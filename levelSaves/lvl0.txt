Welcome to learning to code in Python!

here, you will (hopefully) learn how to code like a pro when you finish
or at least at a more than basic level.

To start of, try typing "move()"
after this comment (limited by the 3 ')

if you mess up, don't worry, use the key r to reset

to play your code just press p

note: all game keypresses have to be done while focused in the pygame window, or else, it will not be registered.

Good luck!
