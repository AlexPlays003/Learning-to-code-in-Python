OMG, the level got longer, plus, crystals appear at random
this will take forever!

from now on, levels will probably become more and more
time consuming. To solve this, I have added a function 
that changes the rate at which the player moves

to do so, use setDelayTime()

remember those parenthesis we told that we would use later?
well, now is the time!

to specify the amount of seconds each move sould take, 
insert the number into the function.

An example would be:
setDelayTime(0.5)

go ahead and try it out!
