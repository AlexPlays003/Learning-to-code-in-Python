I hope you used your new power responsibly

Wither way, this level is a mess, try and 
reach the flag with the least amout on code possible!

so, how did I make the speed change?
It's easy! 
when defining a function, you can tell it to give you
a variable

lets say I want to change the time, and I have a nice clock

time = 10

there, now time keeps the seconds that have passed
but, I want to change it 
instead of having to change time like this:

time = 20

I can make a function that adds time to the current time

def addTime():
	time = time + 10

now, this finction can add 10 to time, but it is not very usefull
I would have to create a different function for every time interval I need
so instead, we can create a function that requests a number

def addTime(timeToAdd):
	
now, the timeToAdd is a variable, but unlike previous variables, 
we do not need to set them in the moment.
and, we can replace the 10 with the variable

def addTime(timeToAdd):
	time = time + timeToAdd

okay, but now how do I add a value to my variable?
you do that when you call the vatiable

addTime(10)

this will add 10 to our time, but now I can do:

addTime(5)

and this will only add 5 to our time

# I will create a move certain spaces for you, so you can see how it is created

def moveSpaces(spacesToMove):
	for i in range(0,spacesToMove):
		move()

# Now, continue the code to try and reach the goal using my function
