Another brether, just to get all sitting in

If you would like to practive a bit more,
try inserting functions into functions

for example:

def moveAmmount(ammount):
	for i in range(0,ammount):
		move()

def moveBackAndFoward():
	moveAmmount(10)
	rotateLeft()
	rotateLeft()
	moveAmmount(10)

and then, you can use moveBackAndFoward to get to a place and return
