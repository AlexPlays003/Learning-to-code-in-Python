Now, learning an if statement
if is what you use in code to ask questions
if you have 10 years, you are a child
if you are 20 years or older, you are an adult

it is the same, ask a question, then do something with that,
to do so, you can use many commands

a == b checks if 2 things are equal
a > b  checks if a is bigger than b
a < b  checks if a is smaller than b
a >= b checks if a is bigger or equal to b
a <= b checks if a is smaller or equal to b
a != b checks if a is NOT equal to b

you can check if you have all the crystals, use:

crystals = getCristalsCollected()
total = getCristalsTotal()

to get the crystals into a variable you can use

NOTE: crystals will not be updated, if you want to update it, run the same code again!
