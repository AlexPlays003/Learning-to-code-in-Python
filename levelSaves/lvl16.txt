'''
in this level, the flag spawns randomly in a series of moves.
this a repeating algorythm that can be solved by doing a simple check,
every time you use the move() function, the function returns either True
or False. if you can move, it returns True, but if there was a water block,
it returns False.

you can do something like:

didItMove = move()
if(didItMove == False):
	turnRight()

didItMove becomes either true or false, but it still does the move() function.

you can then use the value of didItMove to do something with it.

try doing the same to pass this :3

	# write everything within this loop. it will run indefenetly.
