finally, a level that will introduce you to:

FUNCTIONS

it has fun at the beggining, so how hard can it be?


simillar to how you can group tie your shoes to 
"tie your shoes", you can also grop code that gets used
many times over and over.

for example, you can group rotateRight() 3 times to 
rotate left instead.

to do so, in Python, you need to first tell the code 
you are gonna give it a set of instructions

"def" is what python has made into this.

an example would be:

def nameOfFunction():

it is important to add the ":", to add "()" after the name,
and DO NOT use spaces when naming it.

to add anything to your function, 
just write code below it, but use TAB to diferenciate what 
is in the function, and what is not.

def nameOfFunction():
	doManyStuff()

finally, to use your function, just call it using the name

def nameOfFunction():
	doManyStuff()

nameOfFunction()

I'll help you out a bit, you finish it
'''

# here I made the function, it turns right 3 times, to turn left

def left():
	rotateRight()
	rotateRight()
	rotateRight()


# now use the left() function to complete the course
