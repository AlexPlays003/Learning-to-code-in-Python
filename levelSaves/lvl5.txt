Perfect!

you made it, now, try using the same method to move 17 times, 
and save infinite coppy paste.

you might notice that the function is ran before all the code,
this is because Python runs everything from top to bottom,
if your function has not been read, it is as if it does not exist!
so remember to add all your functions on the top.

also, there is a rotateLeft(), so might as well use it
'''

# make your function here




# then do all the other code here
