You are doing great!

before we go into the next step, lets learn how to use loops

loops come in many ways, and serve many different purposes

we are gonna start with a for loop. Use this loop when you have 
a known amount of times you want to repeat something.

like now, we want to repeat move() untill we reach the crystal,
but we know how many spaces there are

to make out loop, use the following sintax

for i in range(0, 10):
	move()

what we are doing here, is repeating the code inside the loop 10 times
range makes the loop do it 10 times, for now, 
we do not need to use the i, but later, we will se what it does.
'''

# I'll help you with the first crystal, if you want, run it to see what it does

rotateLeft()

for i in range(0,17):
	move()

# continue over here
