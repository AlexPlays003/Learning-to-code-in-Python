'''
Now, variables

variables are ways to store things, such as numbers

it is identicall to math
x = 10

if we had a formula, x would now be 10 

b = x + 7

b would now be 17

but if we ran this:

x = 20
b = x + 7

b would now be 27

Python allows to make many different things with variables.
But as of now, we are gonna use integers (defined as int)

so, knowing this, instead of hard coding values into our previous
formula, let's add x

for i in range(0,x)

now, we can use the same code, but changing the distance that 
we travel.
'''


# let me first make x

x = 0

# here, x is now 0, but we could change it later on

# now to make a function

def moveXAmount():
	for i in range(0,x):
		move

# try and change x, and then call the function to make your code smaller
