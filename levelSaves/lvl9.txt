Great!

now to finally get down all you have learnt, try this

you can use any methods you want. 

however, you can run loops inside loops, for example 

for i in range(0,10):
	move()
	rotateRight()
	for i in range(0,10):
		move()

		
doing this allows you to first move and turn, then move 10 times
and it will repeat 10 times

good luck!
