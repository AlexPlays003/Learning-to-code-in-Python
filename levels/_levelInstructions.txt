a file format to create a new level consits of 3 parts, X wisth value, Y width value, and the level itself. 
To create a level, the tilemap will be placed as follows:
     G = grass tile
     W = water tile
     M = goal (in this case, the goal will be randerized as different sprite, with a background grass tile)
     P = player (in this case, the goal will be randerized as different sprite, with a background grass tile)
     S = special tile (a gem will be added to a grass tile. The gems will get automatically added to a counter, if none are present, no gem requirement will be needed)


An example to the file is:
4 (meaning its 4 tiles tall)
5 (meaning its 5 tiles wide)
WGGGG
GGPGG
GGMGG
GGGGW
(and the 'G' represents each tile. anything outside of the specified are by the first 2 values will be ignored)
